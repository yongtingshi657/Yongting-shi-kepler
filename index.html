        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Yongting, and you can call me Tina. I graduated from Florida Atlantic University (FAU) with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a minor in Business Analytics. Throughout my academic journey, I developed expertise in marketing and economics, with a strong focus on identifying key trends and relationships to support data-driven decision-making.  </p>
        <p>Currently, I work as an independent contractor, helping small businesses increase their visibility within the community. I specialize in marketing through social media and website SEO strategies. I am excited to expand my skill set by learning coding through Code the Dream. </p>
